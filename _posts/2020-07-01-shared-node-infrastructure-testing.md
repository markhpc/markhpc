# Low core count Ceph Testing

This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jDHQQ6XGzAJ3ahJ_6n19LnMMx_whyw2hiKi4KvZrp2M/edit?usp=sharing) shows the results of rbd and cephfs tests with OSDs run at low core counts.  Performance in some cases scales linearly with the number of cores up to 2-3 physical cores per OSD.
