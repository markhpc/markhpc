# New OmapBench Tool

I started working on a new tool to specifically test Omap performance.  Sadly it's just a gtest suite benchmark and can't be run against an existing OSD.  Maybe it can be turned into something more at some point though.  Code is [here](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/39976) and benchmarks going back to luminous are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wr5r_ayssULWegx-J0QOvbZlnB5gmfrvb6sGVcuBqI/edit?usp=sharing).
