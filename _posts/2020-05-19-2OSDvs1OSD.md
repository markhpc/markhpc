# 2 OSD vs 1 OSD per NVMe Analysis

Recently I was asked about Ceph performance when using 2 NVMe drives per OSD vs 1 NVMe drive per OSD.  I was able to use the Officinalus cluster that Intel graciously donated to the Ceph community and get updated data.  This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5eTeHdZnSizoY6AUjH0knb4jTCW7KMU4RoryLX9EHQ/edit?usp=sharing) shows the behavior on Nautilus, Octopus, and the upcoming Pacific releases.  The gist of it is that we've improved performance quite a bit and putting 2 OSDs on each NVMe drive isn't necessarily a big gain the way it was in Nautilus.
