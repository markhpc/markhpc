# Experimenting with Igor's Bluestore WAL

Igor Fedetov is one of the most knowledgable developers working on Ceph.  He's started working on replacing our use of RocksDB's write ahead log with a bluestore native implementation.  After tuning we can [achieve](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zETd1Nq_CbLNSh3R2II-z8efQizUjDYfHDBIcMwGNdg/edit?usp=sharing) up to 122K random write IOPS on a single OSD!  That's nearly a 50% improvment over the current main branch and over twice as fast as Pacific!
