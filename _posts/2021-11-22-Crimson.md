# Ceph Crimson 2021 Quarter 3 Project Update

This is the first time we're seeing Bluestore in Crimson beating Bluestore in Classic in some (low core count) tests.  Starting to see lower tail latency as well which is a really good sign.  Top end performance will be contingent on multi-reactor support though.
