# Testing the new Ceph Upstream Mako cluster

Red Hat and Samsung generously donated a new AMD test cluster to the upstream Ceph community called Mako.  [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WqVGdO_JxVWyboktK6N6raqSJZWBEyN2F4QOg29cqA/edit?usp=sharing) are some initial RBD and RGW test results from the cluster.  We were even able to find several RGW performance regressions between Nautilus and Pacific and track down the exact commits where they occured!
