# Hotsuace S3 Benchmark Tool

I created a new S3 bechmarking tool called [Hotsauce](https://github.com/markhpc/hsbench) based on [wasabi-tech/s3-benchmark](https://github.com/wasabi-tech/s3-benchmark).  Features include object prefix support, distributing IOs across buckets, easy CLI usage, etc.  Check it out!
