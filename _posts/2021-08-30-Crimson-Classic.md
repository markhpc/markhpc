# Crimson vs Classic 1 NVMe Multi-OSD Analysis

[Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14HMaGxstvWSjobdyAlTdTG_yqhJh7K71Q5rSaxb1S6M/edit?usp=sharing) looking at Crimson vs Classic performance when scaling multiple OSDs on one NVMe drive.  Done to simulate what we can hopefully expect from multi-reactor down the road.  Includes cycles/OP comparisons as well.
